# Machine Learning Course Assignments

This repository contains my solutions to three assignments from my Foundations of Machine Learning course at Dalhousie University. These assignments cover a range of topics including distributions, sample generation, synthetic clustered datasets, k-nearest neighbors, neural networks, convolutional neural networks, and multi-layer perceptrons.

## Assignment 1: Basic Concepts and Implementations

- **Distributions:** Computation of expected values, variances, and entropies for distributions generated by some given functions.
- **Sample Generation:** Simulation of rolling two six-sided dice, one fair and one loaded, using a uniform distribution.
- **Synthetic Clustered Dataset:** Generation of a dataset with three circular clusters and visualization.
- **KNN:** Implementation of the k-nearest neighbors algorithm.

## Assignment 2: Neural Networks and Image Classification

- **MNIST Digits Classification:** Experimentation with different hyperparameters of a neural network using the MNIST digits dataset.
- **CIFAR-100 Image Classification:** Construction and analysis of a neural network with modifications to observe changes in generalization.

## Assignment 3: Advanced Neural Networks

- **Convolutional Neural Networks:** Training and assessment of a convolutional neural network on the CIFAR-100 dataset.
- **Multi-layer Perceptrons:** Implementation of a feedforward neural network by hand for binary classification.

## Assignment 4: K-means clustering
- **K-means Algorithm:** Developed the K-means clustering algorithm from scratch and optimized the number of clusters using the silhouette score.
- **Cluster Visualization:** Visualized the clustering performance on a synthetic Gaussian clustered dataset.

## Dependencies

- Python
- NumPy
- Keras
